# Senior Fullstack Application Developer

Welcome!

We will use this project in order to evaluate your skill in the following areas:

* Taking existing high-level requirements and translating them to a functional
  application
* Writing production level code that does not depend on gigabytes of npm
  packages
* Communicating with the team when working on the challenge
* Handling feedback

We believe this technique is not only better but also more fun compared to
whiteboard/quiz interviews so common in the industry. It’s not without the
downsides - it could take longer than traditional interviews. That said, it's
our view that this type of challenge gives us a more accurate assessment of your
ability to work well on the types of projects we’re working on day-to-day here. [Some of the best teams use coding
challenges](https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/). We
appreciate your time and are looking forward to hacking on this project
together.

When you are done with your code add the github username: cartolinks to the github project and also submit it via the google form
## Summary

In this challenge, you will build an application that allows a user to browse
directory content on a remote server. Think Google Drive, Dropbox, or even
GitHub's file browser.

When you are ready to begin, we will invite you to a GitHub repository where you
will collaborate with a few members of the team on the challenge. The repository
has some starter code to save you some time in bootstrapping a project. You are
welcome to replace any of this code if you choose, so long as you continue to
meet the requirements of the challenge.

## Tools

In order to provide an experience similar to working on Cartolink itself, we've
selected tools that align with our internal development environment.

* Version control and code review performed via GitHub
* The backend API is written in Python
* The frontend is a React app written in TypeScript

At Carolinks, we use [styled components](https://styled-components.com) for
styling, but you are not required to use them for this challenge.



## Requirements - Level 4

Implement an application that allows a user to browse directory content on a
remote server.

This application should have the following functionality:

* A Python backend that serves the webapp and an API
* The UI, which should include client-side filtering and sorting capabilities
  and URL-based navigation.
* Strong authentication

Additionally, we are a security-focused company and place an extra emphasis on
security for senior engineering candidates. We will expect your solution to have
a strong security posture as it pertains to authentication, encryption, and
overall web security.

### API

The repository we invite you to includes just enough starter code to serve up
both the web app and a sample API endpoint.

The starter code here only listens for plain-text HTTP. At Cartolinks, we avoid
plain-text connections and prefer to encrypt all data in transit. You will be
responsible for adding TLS.

Your API only needs to return the contents of the specified directory and does
not need to recurse into subdirectories. The following is an example of an
acceptable API response:

```json
{
  "name": "example",
  "type": "dir",
  "size": 0,

  "contents": [
    {
      "name": "README.md",
      "type": "file",
      "size": 12345,
    },
    {
      "name": "images",
      "type": "dir",
      "size": 0,
    }
  ]
}
```

When you add authentication (the requirements for which are outlined later in
this document), the API will also need to support session management (logging in
and out).

### UI

The UI should allow a user to view the contents of a single directory. Clicking
on a subdirectory should navigate to that directory and refresh the contents.
Unlike other commercial tools, _file preview is not required_. Clicking on a
file should not do anything.

The following features are required:

* [ ] Display the filename, type (file or directory), and human-readable size for files.
* [ ] Add support for filtering the directory contents based on filename.
  Filtering should be performed client-side, and a simple substring match is
  sufficient.
* [ ] Add support for sorting directory contents based on filename, type, and
  size.
* [ ] Include breadcrumbs that show the current location in the directory. The
  breadcrums should be clickable for easy navigation to parent directories.
* [ ] Implement URL navigation. The state of the app should be encoded in the
  URL. No state should be lost upon a page refresh.

While third-party dependencies are acceptable, we prefer to minimize the use of
dependencies where possible. For example:

* We prefer you use native browser APIs like
  [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) over
  third-party libraries like Axios.
* We're happy to see borrowed CSS from other projects to get a nice look and feel,
  but we do want the opportunity to evaluate how you design reusable components.
  Please implement your own components rather than using large frameworks that
  already provide components for breadcrumbs, tree-views, etc.

### Authentication

The app should also present directory information only to authenticated users.
This will require changes to both the API and the UI.

The following features are required:

* [ ] The API should reject requests from unauthenticated users
* [ ] The UI should redirect unauthenticated users to a login page. After a
  succesful login, users should be directed back to the page they initially
  requested.
* [ ] The UI should provide a way for users to log out.

User sessions can be stored in memory, there is no need for a database of any
kind.

User registration / enrollment is not required. You are welcome to hard-code one
or two valid users, just let us know what their credentials are for testing
purposes.

Please do not use a third party solution that provides authentication out of
the box.

## Interview process

Before writing the actual code, create a brief design document and share with
the team. At Cartolinks, we prefer Markdown for
[our designs](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0000-rfds.md).

This document should include:

- the proposed UX of the app (wireframes are great)
- the proposed API
- URL structure (how will you encode the app state in the URL?)
- security, including:
  - authentication
  - TLS setup
  - protection against common web security vulnerabilities
- implementation details where appropriate (for example, session management)

A few notes about the design document:

* We expect the design document to be complete roughly within the first week.
  This is to ensure you have enough time to work on the implementation.
* Avoid writing an overly detailed design document. Two to three pages is
  sufficient.
* Avoid sending us draft design documents, it is difficult to evaluate what
  parts are draft and which parts are complete. Instead we encourage asking
  questions in Slack and sharing a design document that is ready to be
  reviewed.
* When you feel it's ready, create a PR for this document to allow the team to
  review and comment on it.

Split your code submission into a series of pull requests that are easy for the
team to review in a single sitting. A good “rule of thumb” is to aim to complete
the project in 3-4 PRs.


## Code and project ownership

This is a test challenge and we have no intent of using the code you've
submitted in production. This is your work, and you are free to do whatever you
feel is reasonable with it. In the scenario where you don’t pass, you can open
source it with any license and use it as a portfolio project.

## Areas of focus

These are the areas we will be evaluating in the submission:

* Use consistent coding style. We use the recommended
  [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#using-eslintrecommended)
  and
  [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react#configuration)
  rules for JS, and format our code with [prettier](https://prettier.io/).
* Create a few unit-tests for scenarios you think make sense.
* Make sure builds are reproducible. Pick any vendoring/packaging system that
  will allow us to get consistent build results.
* Ensure error handling and error reporting is consistent. The app should report
  clear errors and not crash under non-critical conditions.
* Ensure that your app is secure.

The primary factor in the decision is overall code quality. We are looking for
the highest possible quality with the smallest possible scope that meets the requirements
of the challenge.

## Pitfalls and Gotchas

To help you out, we’ve composed a list of things that previously resulted in a
no-pass from the interview team:

* Scope creep. Candidates have tried to implement too much and ran out of time.
   * Avoid implementing an overly complex solution just to show that you are
     capable of writing a complex feature. Instead, if you think something could
     be made more complex in a full-fledged app, leave a comment about it and
     move on with a solution which solves the problem at hand.
   * For example, there is no need to implement a pluggable auth system which in
     the future would let you easily switch between different auth methods. It
     is better to focus on implementing a single auth method.
* Error handling. We pay extra attention to error handling. Make sure that they
  are properly handled and not ignored.
* Keep your CSS simple. We are not looking for animations or complex themes, but
  do want to see a responsive app that looks good on various screen sizes. Make
  sure that a long directory name doesn't break your layout.
* Make sure that your code is secured and your application is not vulnerable to
  common web security vulnerabilities.
    * Recommended resources:
        * [Authentication Cheat
          Sheat](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)
        * [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
* For a senior level, make sure you have a good crypto setup and secure session
  management.

## Scoring

We want to be as transparent as possible on how we will be scoring your
submission. You will be evaluated on the following criteria:

* The submitted code has a clear and modular structure.
* The candidate outlined the key design points in the design document.
* The code provides examples of tests covering key components.
* The code provides clear error handling and reporting.
* The app works according to the specifications, no bugs.
* The candidate demonstrates an ability to handle and apply feedback.
* The code is not vulnerable to common web security vulnerabilities.

## Questions


> What version of Python should I use? What dependency manager should I use?

Unless specified in the requirements, pick the solution that works best for you.

## Timing

You can split coding over a couple of days


Within this time frame, we don't give higher scores to challenges submitted more
quickly. We only evaluate the quality of the submission.
